# Structure_Visualization
1-, 2-, and 3-D visualizations of SNPs and Protein Interaction Data

<h2>Usage</h2>
You can start with the page "start.html", mouse over SNP position, click "iCn3D" to link to the 3D viewer iCn3D "icn3d_embed.html". In iCn3D, you can click "Sequence Viewer" button to link back to Sequence Viewer "sviewer.html" and show the neighboring residues in tracks. These residues are 5 angstrom from the starting SNP.

<h2>Tools depending on</h2>
We embedded NCBI Sequence Viewer in the pages "start.html" and "sviewer.html" to show sequence and annotations. We also embedded NCBI WebGL-based 3D viewer "iCn3D" in the page "icn3d_embed.html". iCn3D was released to GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d">https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d</a>.
