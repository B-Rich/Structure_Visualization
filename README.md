# Structure_Visualization
1-, 2-, and 3-D visualizations of SNPs and Protein Interaction Data

You can start with the page start.html, mouse over SNP position, click "iCn3D" to link to the 3D viewer iCn3D. In iCn3D, you can click "Sequence Viewer" button to link back to Sequence Viewer and show the neighboring residues in tracks. These residues are 5 angstrom from the starting SNP.

The source of iCn3D will be in another GitHub release in a few days. THe location will be udated here.
